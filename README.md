# b4app: Personal Agent Workspace

A native Swift app for running Codex, Claude Code, and B4 agent conversations side by side on one Mac, with an iOS companion built from the same code. Everything is local: no accounts, no cloud sync, no telemetry.

Status: M0 baseline and application shell. No provider conversations yet. See `docs/milestones.md`.

## Prerequisites

- macOS 26 on Apple Silicon with Xcode 26.6 (Swift 6.3)
- XcodeGen for the app projects: `brew install xcodegen`

## Build and test

```bash
swift build
```

```bash
swift test
```

```bash
./Scripts/generate-project.sh
```

Then open `B4App.xcodeproj` and run the `B4App-macOS` or `B4App-iOS` scheme, or build from the command line:

```bash
xcodebuild build -project B4App.xcodeproj -scheme B4App-macOS -destination 'platform=macOS'
```

```bash
xcodebuild build -project B4App.xcodeproj -scheme B4App-iOS -destination 'generic/platform=iOS Simulator'
```

## CLI

```bash
.build/debug/agent-workspace doctor --json
```

The CLI connects to the running coordinator or starts `b4app-coordinator` next to itself. Set `B4APP_RUNTIME_DIR` and `B4APP_DATA_DIR` to isolate an experiment from the real data under `~/Library/Application Support/b4app`.

## Layout

```
Package.swift            umbrella package: libraries, coordinator, CLI, tests
Sources/WorkspaceProtocol   commands, events, errors, domain (runtime-neutral)
Sources/WorkspaceClient     typed coordinator client (runtime-neutral)
Sources/WorkspaceUI         SwiftUI shared by macOS and iOS
Sources/WorkspacePlatform   paths, executables, processes, Keychain, lock
Sources/WorkspaceStorage    GRDB schema and repositories
Sources/Coordinator         event log, router, socket server, launcher
Sources/CoordinatorMain     the b4app-coordinator executable
Sources/AgentWorkspaceCLI   the agent-workspace executable
Sources/NIOTransport        Unix socket transport
Sources/CodexAdapter, ClaudeAdapter, B4Adapter
Apps/macOS, Apps/iOS        thin app targets (project.yml, XcodeGen)
