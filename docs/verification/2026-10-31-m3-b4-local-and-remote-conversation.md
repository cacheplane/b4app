## 2026-10-31: M3 B4 local and remote conversation

Target: the same MacBook Pro (macOS 26.5, Xcode 26.6, Swift 6.3.3). No `b4` on PATH. Fixture runs use `Tests/B4AdapterTests/Fixtures/fake-b4.py`, a stdlib Python server that implements the Agent Protocol subset the adapter uses with the shapes read from `@b4run/cli` 0.15.8 source and corrected from the live run. Live runs use a scratch project with `@b4run/cli` 0.15.8 project-installed, one `gpt-5-mini` `agent()` route, a `workspace/` directory, and `OPENAI_API_KEY` loaded by `b4 dev --env-file` from this repo's gitignored `.env` (the key was copied from the b4run checkout and checked against `GET /v1/models`, HTTP 200).

### Live against a real B4 server (`b4 dev` 0.15.8 on 127.0.0.1:3101)

| Scenario | How | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Opt-in adapter test | `B4APP_LIVE_B4_URL=http://127.0.0.1:3101 B4APP_LIVE_B4_ROUTE=/chat#agent swift test --filter B4Live` | Pass in 3 s: inspection `ready`, thread `t-…`, reply "pong" `completed`, cancel of a counting turn confirmed and finished `cancelled`, history `[userMessage, agentMessage, userMessage]`, reconcile of the first turn `completed`. |
| CLI attach and turns | `connection add --kind b4 --url http://127.0.0.1:3101 --route /chat#agent`, `thread new`, `turn send` | Pass: `ready / not_required`; "pong" streamed in 2.0 s; a second turn answered "pong" from the same native thread (continuity). |
| Real permission prompt | `turn send --no-wait <id> "Use your runBash tool to run exactly: ls -la …"`, `thread show`, `request respond <rid> --accept` | Pass: the turn parked `waiting_for_user` with a `command_approval` request carrying the server's `interrupt` envelope (`perm-…`, `kind: command`, `detail.command: "ls -la"`, `toolCallId`); `--accept` resumed it; the transcript ended with the tool card, then "AGENTS.md\nnotes.txt"; the turn was `completed`. |
| Tool card from live `step` frames | `turn send <id> "Use your runBash tool to run exactly: pwd …"` | Pass: `[toolCall started]`, `[toolCall completed] pwd`, one card labelled "Ran pwd" with the output, then the answer. No `step` or `usage` items in the transcript. |
| Parked prompt across a real server restart and a coordinator restart | park on `ls -la`; stop `b4 dev` and the coordinator; start `b4 dev` again on the same `.b4/{threads,checkpoints}.sqlite`; fresh coordinator `thread show`; `request respond --accept` | Pass: after the restart `GET /threads/:id` still read `interrupted` with `metadata.parked_route` and `GET /pending_interrupts` listed the same `perm-…` prompt; `thread show` on the fresh coordinator reconciled the turn to `waiting_for_user` with the request re-opened at adapter generation 2; `--accept` resumed the run, the tool card showed `ls -la`, the answer listed the files, and the turn ended `completed`. The server's turn list showed one `done` turn per prompt sent. |
| Raw protocol capture | `curl -N` of `runs/stream`, `GET /turns`, `GET /state`, `GET /pending_interrupts` | Recorded in `docs/research/2026-10-30-b4-runtime.md`. Two differences from the source reading were found and fixed before merging: `GET /turns` nests the list under `turns.turns` (the ordinal reconcile had silently fallen back to status-only and reported the wrong outcome), and `usage`/`step` events plus serialized `ToolMessage` outputs needed folding instead of rendering as items. |

Not exercised live: a remote HTTPS endpoint with a real endpoint credential, approval grants, `detached capacity`, the macOS forms (built, not clicked).

### Live Codex approval (M1 gate closed from this branch)

| Scenario | How | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Approval under the owner's configuration | CLI thread, "create `/tmp/…` with a shell command" | No request: `~/.codex/config.toml` sets `approval_policy = "never"` and `sandbox_mode = "danger-full-access"`, so Codex ran `printf hello > /tmp/…` directly. Honest result for daily use on this Mac. |
| Real `item/commandExecution/requestApproval` round trip | `B4APP_LIVE_CODEX=1 B4APP_LIVE_CODEX_APPROVALS=1 swift test --filter CodexLiveTests/commandApprovalRoundTrip` (the test alone asks `thread/start` for `on-request` + `workspace-write`) | Pass in 6.4 s: the request arrived as `command_approval` with `command: /bin/zsh -lc 'curl -sI https://example.com'`, `cwd`, and `reason: "Allow curl to access https://example.com outside the network-blocked sandbox?"`; `allow_once` → `{ decision: accept }`; the turn completed and the reply was `HTTP/2 200`. A first attempt that wrote under `/tmp` needed no approval because `workspace-write` keeps `/tmp` writable. |

### Automated

| Check | Command | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Format lint | `swift format lint --strict --recursive Sources Tests Apps Package.swift` | Pass |
| Build | `swift build` | Pass |
| Tests | `swift test` | Pass: 180 tests in 35 suites (35 new) |
| macOS app | `xcodebuild build -scheme B4App-macOS -destination 'platform=macOS'` | Pass |
| iOS app | `xcodebuild build -scheme B4App-iOS -destination 'generic/platform=iOS Simulator'` | Pass |
| Live B4 (opt-in) | `B4APP_LIVE_B4_URL=http://127.0.0.1:3101 B4APP_LIVE_B4_ROUTE=/chat#agent swift test --filter B4Live` | Pass in 3 s against `b4 dev` 0.15.8 with gpt-5-mini (see the live table) |

New fixture coverage: `B4TurnTranslator` (ordered streamed turn, tool calls paired with results and messages split around them, park keeps the turn open and the resume stream continues item numbering, failed and cancelled outcomes, final message from `done.output` when nothing streamed including LangChain envelopes, capability events and reasoning visible, reattach `state live:false` ends without an outcome, durable prompt re-open, transport-loss event); `B4Protocol` (route keys, HTTP error mapping, exact resume bodies, decision mapping, LangChain state projection); `B4Adapter` against the fixture (inspect, create, two consecutive turns with ordinals `turn-1`/`turn-2`, tool turn and `loadSession` history, park then `once` with a stale second answer refused, `always`/`deny`/decline all reaching the server, stop on a parked turn declining the prompt, hang then cancel with a later stop returning the known outcome, failed run, **dropped stream reattached with one server-side turn**, **parked prompt answerable after a server restart** under a new generation, **server restart mid-run fails the turn and the thread accepts the next one**, reconcile distinguishing recorded from unrecorded ordinals with a `submission_unknown` error event, bearer middleware 401 as `auth_required` then success with the credential, unknown route 404 and `workflow` route as compatibility results, malformed route as an error); `SessionService` over the socket (a B4 conversation beside Codex with both threads listed and re-adding the same endpoint returning the same connection, a permission answered through `request.respond` with the turn `waiting_for_user` in between, `credential.add` producing a reference the endpoint accepts while an unknown reference is refused and an anonymous turn fails `auth_required`, route and URL problems rejected with codes, **a parked B4 turn answerable after a coordinator restart** via `thread.read` reconciliation to `waiting_for_user`).

### Live on the target Mac (coordinator and CLI against the fixture server)

| Scenario | How | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Credential path | `echo s3cret \| agent-workspace credential add fake-endpoint` with scratch `B4APP_RUNTIME_DIR`/`B4APP_DATA_DIR` | Pass: printed `Stored "fake-endpoint" as secret:<uuid>` and the `connection add` hint; the value appeared nowhere else. The item was written to the login keychain (service `b4app`) by the real `KeychainSecretStore` and removed afterwards. The TTY `readpassphrase` path was not exercised (no terminal in this session). |
| Attach an endpoint with the credential | `connection add --kind b4 --url http://127.0.0.1:<port> --route /chat#agent --auth-ref secret:<uuid> --name fake-b4` | Pass: `ready / auth=unknown`, `route /chat#agent (attached_local)`, message "Server reachable (readyz: ready). Model credentials are not verified by this check." Exit 0. |
| Workflow route | `connection add --kind b4 … --route /dispatch#workflow` | Stored as `incompatible` with "Route /dispatch#workflow is a workflow route. Conversations support standard agent routes only (D-023)." Exit 2. |
| Remote plain HTTP | `connection add --kind b4 --url http://agent.example.com …` | Refused `protocol_invalid` "Remote B4 endpoints must use HTTPS". Exit 4. |
| Thread and streamed turn | `thread new --connection fake-b4 --title smoke`, `turn send <id> hello there` | Pass: thread `native thr_1 route /chat#agent`; streamed "Hello from fake B4." then `[turn completed]`, exit 0. |
| Permission through the CLI | `turn send --no-wait <id> please approve`, `thread show`, `request respond <rid> --accept` | Pass: `thread show` listed the `command_approval` request with `command: rm -rf tmp` and the `request respond` hint; after `--accept` the transcript ended with "Approved (once). Command ran." and the turn was `completed`. |
| Stop a running turn | `turn send --no-wait <id> hang around`, `turn interrupt <id>` | Pass: `stopping`, then `turn-4 terminal cancelled`. |
| Reopen after a coordinator restart | `thread show` from a fresh coordinator process | Pass: three terminal turns and seven cached items; no reconciliation needed. |
| Missing credential | keychain item deleted, then `turn send <id> hello` | Failed honestly with `auth_required` "Credential secret:<uuid> is not in the credential store. Run `agent-workspace credential add` and update the connection." Exit 1. |
| No resubmission | `GET /threads/thr_1/turns` on the fixture after the session | `idle`, exactly one server-side turn per `turn send` (`run_2`, `run_6`, `run_13` all `done`). |
| Doctor | `agent-workspace doctor` | Lists each B4 connection as a runtime row with its reachability message. |

### Open after M3

- A compatible remote HTTPS endpoint with its real endpoint credential has not been attached; the local live run used no middleware.
- Approval grants (`approvals.grants`) are reviewed from source and fixture-tested only.
- The macOS Connections form and new-thread sheet for B4 build but were not clicked through in this session.
- Mac sleep/wake across a long SSE stream and the reattach cap (`detached capacity`) are untested.
