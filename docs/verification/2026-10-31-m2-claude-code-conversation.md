## 2026-10-31: M2 Claude Code conversation

Target: the same MacBook Pro (macOS 26.5, Xcode 26.6, Swift 6.3.3), Claude Code 2.1.282 at `~/.local/bin/claude`, **signed out** (`claude auth status --json` → `loggedIn: false`) for the whole session.

### Automated

| Check | Command | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Format lint | `swift format lint --strict --recursive Sources Tests Apps Package.swift` | Pass |
| Build | `swift build` | Pass |
| Tests | `swift test` | Pass: 145 tests in 30 suites (21 new) |
| macOS app | `xcodebuild build -scheme B4App-macOS -destination 'platform=macOS'` | Pass |
| iOS app | `xcodebuild build -scheme B4App-iOS -destination 'generic/platform=iOS Simulator'` | Pass |
| Live Claude (opt-in) | `B4APP_LIVE_CLAUDE=1 swift test --filter ClaudeLive` | **Not run**: requires `claude auth login` first |

New fixture coverage: `ClaudeTurnTracker` (streamed turn in order, `result success` with `is_error` → failed with `auth_required`, interrupt → cancelled by flag and by `terminal_reason`, tool_use paired with its tool_result, permission and question requests with safe payloads and synthetic question ids, elicitation marked unanswerable, `control_cancel_request`, session state, `apiKeySource` conflict, process exit ending the turn and scoping the disconnect, transcript snapshots); `ClaudeSession` and `ClaudeAdapter` against `Tests/ClaudeAdapterTests/Fixtures/fake-claude.py` (inspect and login URL capture, session + streamed turn, permission allowed then stale, permission denied with a failed tool result, question answers passed through by question text, elicitation auto-declined, hang + interrupt → cancelled, crash → failed turn + thread-scoped disconnect + resume on the next send with a new generation, failed result error code, `--resume` of a known session and `native_session_missing` for an unknown one, `loadSession` from the transcript file); `SessionService` over the socket (a Claude conversation beside a Codex thread with both connections listed, a Claude tool permission answered exactly once through `request.respond`, a Claude crash leaving the Codex request pending and both connections `ready`).

### Live on the target Mac

| Scenario | How | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Protocol shapes while signed out | Raw `claude` launch with the adapter's argv, `initialize` + one `user` message on stdin | Recorded in `docs/research/2026-10-30-claude-cli-stream-protocol.md`: hooks before the handshake, `command_lifecycle`, `system/init` with `apiKeySource: none`, replayed user frame, synthetic `assistant` error, `result success` with `is_error: true`. `--resume` of an unknown id → `result error_during_execution`, exit 1. |
| Claude connection registration | `agent-workspace connection add --kind claude` (scratch directories) | Pass, honest: `ready / auth_required`, version 2.1.282, message "Not signed in. Run `claude auth login` or use Sign in from the Connections screen." Exit 0. |
| Thread creation while signed out | `agent-workspace thread new --connection claude --cwd <dir>` | Refused with `auth_required`, exit 1. No process was left behind. |
| Codex unaffected | `connection add --kind codex` in the same coordinator | `ready / authenticated` beside the Claude row. |

### Not exercised (open gates)

- Any Claude inference: streaming, a real `can_use_tool`, `AskUserQuestion`, the `result` after `interrupt`, and resume with `--resume`. Sign in with `claude auth login`, then run the live test; it prints the reply, the interrupt outcome, and the resume answer.
- `claude auth login` through the app or CLI (it opens the owner's browser; not triggered unattended).
- Interactive use of the macOS window (screen-recording permission declined).
