## 2026-10-30: M1 Codex conversation

Target: the same MacBook Pro (macOS 26.5, Xcode 26.6, Swift 6.3.3), codex-cli 0.166.0 from the Homebrew cask, signed in with ChatGPT.

### Automated

| Check | Command | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Format lint | `swift format lint --strict --recursive Sources Tests Apps Package.swift` | Pass |
| Build | `swift build` | Pass |
| Tests | `swift test` | Pass: 124 tests in 26 suites (37 new) |
| macOS app | `xcodebuild build -scheme B4App-macOS -destination 'platform=macOS'` | Pass |
| iOS app | `xcodebuild build -scheme B4App-iOS -destination 'generic/platform=iOS Simulator'` | Pass |
| Live Codex (opt-in) | `B4APP_LIVE_CODEX=1 swift test --filter CodexLive` | Pass in 9.7 s: handshake, account, thread, "pong" turn, interrupt → cancelled, reopen with history |

New fixture coverage: `StreamingProcess` (echo, terminate, stderr tail, write after exit, missing executable); Codex event translation for a streamed turn, interrupted and failed turns with mapped error codes, approval requests with a safe payload, every server request method's kind and decline body, account notifications, thread status, history snapshots; `CodexAppServer` and `CodexAdapter` against `Tests/CodexAdapterTests/Fixtures/fake-codex.py` (handshake and account, streamed turn, approval answered with the user's decision then stale on a second answer, unsupported permissions request declined automatically, user question answers passed through, `thread/resume` before `turn/start` and `native_session_missing`, interrupt → cancelled, process exit mid-turn then restart on the next send, failed turn error code); storage upsert by native item id with stable sequence, active-turn lookup, request expiry per connection, snapshot replacement keeping live items; protocol mutation flags for the nine new methods; `SessionService` over the real socket (whole conversation with user and assistant items persisted, second turn refused while one is active, retry with the same `operationId` returning the same turn, approval answered exactly once, runtime exit leaving the turn `reconciling` with submission `unknown` and refusing dispatch, failed dispatch keeping the user message, pending requests expiring and turns reconciling across a coordinator restart).

### Live on the target Mac

| Scenario | How | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Codex connection registration | `agent-workspace connection add --kind codex` with scratch `B4APP_RUNTIME_DIR` and `B4APP_DATA_DIR` | Pass. Found `/opt/homebrew/bin/codex` 0.166.0, `account/read` reported the ChatGPT account (`promax`), connection stored `ready / authenticated`, capabilities recorded. Exit 0. |
| New thread in a directory | `agent-workspace thread new --connection codex --cwd <dir> --title "Live check"` | Pass. `thread/start` returned native id `01a18f32-…`; the thread row carries the account email as `nativeScope`. |
| Real streamed turn | `agent-workspace turn send <id> Reply with exactly the single word: pong` | Pass in 3.5 s. Deltas streamed to the terminal, `[turn completed]`, exit 0. |
| Tool turn | `turn send <id> Read README.txt …` | Pass in 4.9 s. Codex ran `/bin/zsh -lc 'cat README.txt'` (shown as a tool card with its output), then answered with the file contents. No approval was requested under the user's Codex configuration, so the approval path was not exercised live. |
| Stop | `turn send … Count slowly from 1 to 3000 …` in the background, `turn interrupt <id>` after 6 s | Pass. The in-flight numbers drained, `[turn cancelled]`, exit 130; `thread show` lists the turn with a `reasoning` item and no assistant text. |
| Reopen the same native thread | `CodexLive` test: dispose the adapter, create a new one, `loadSession` | Pass. `thread/resume` + `thread/turns/list` returned the earlier user message and the "pong" reply. |
| macOS app hosts the coordinator during a live turn | Built `Agent Workspace.app` launched from the command line with the scratch directories; `agent-workspace doctor`, `thread list`, `turn send <id> … pong2` | Pass. The lock carried the app's pid (4700), the CLI reused it, the second turn completed through the app-hosted coordinator, and `thread show` listed both turns. |
| Conversation UI rendering | `ImageRenderer` of `TranscriptRow`, `RuntimeRequestList`, `ComposerView`, and `TurnStatusBadge` with representative items (throwaway test, not committed) | Pass. User bubble, Markdown assistant text, collapsed command card with status, live streaming text, "Turn stopped." note, "Waiting for you" badge, approval card with Allow once / Allow for session / Deny, question card, composer with Stop and a disabled Send while a turn is active. `ScrollView`, `TextEditor`, and `Picker` do not render through `ImageRenderer` and were checked by build only. |

### Not exercised (open gates)

- A real approval or user-question request from Codex. The coordinator, adapter, CLI, and UI paths are fixture-tested end to end; trigger one live by asking Codex to run a command outside its sandbox policy.
- Interactive use of the macOS window (screen-recording permission declined). The window was not clicked through; the shared SwiftUI code built for both platforms and rendered in isolation.
- `account/login/completed` from a signed-out state (the Mac stayed signed in).
- Mac sleep/wake with an app-server running; the minimal packaged Finder launch (M6).
